# DirectXPlayground
my playground for hooking DirectX in Minecraft for Windows

## paster warning
DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT AS A BASE

this repository is only meant to be used as a resource, and building a client directly from this code would be very impractical

## more info
i organized the different experiments into different branches

right now you're on the main branch, which just has a basic hooking example
