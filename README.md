# DirectXPlayground
my playground for hooking DirectX in Minecraft for Windows

*also the first C++ project i've made public on GitHub*

## more info
i organized the different experiments into different branches

right now you're on the d3d11-fallback+d2d-renderer branch, which forces the game to run on d3d11 instead of d3d12
